<center><h4>Habitat Codes for MBBS Routes</h4></center>



The objective in recording habitats at each stop is to produce information
about

<p>

<ul>

<li>the overall distribution of habitats along a route


<p>

<li>any changes in habitats from year to year

</ul>

<p>

We cannot hope to explain the occurrence of every species at every stop.  
Birds can often be heard from a long way away, and some have specific
requirements.  So to explain every species' presence or absence would
require a major effort to survey habitats in detail over a large area at
each stop.

<p>

Instead, we want to use our habitat codes to provide an overall
description of habitats along each route for comparison with the total
counts of species along the entire route.

<p>

A simple way to achieve this goal is to record the habitat immediately
adjacent to each stop.  It is best to keep our codes simple, even though
some (but preferably not too many) atypical situations get shoe-horned
into strange categories.

<p>

The following prcedures put emphasis on distinguishing areas heavily used
by humans from all other areas.  Studies tend to show that heavy human use
has major consequences for avian populations.

<p><p>

<center><h4>Procedure</h4></center>

<p>

(1) Each year take along your codes from previous years and <font
color=#ff0000><b>use the same codes again</b></font> -- except . . .

<p>

(2) When you see that the habitat at a stop has changed (for instance, a
clear-cut has become overgrown, a new clear-cut or development has
replaced forest) -- <font color=#ff0000><b>mark the new habitat code with an
asterisk</b></font>.

<p>

(3) Focus on the habitat directly to the left and right of the exact place
where you stop (if the stop is at an edge between two kinds of habitat,
make a decision about which side of the edge you are on, even if only by
one foot!)

<p>

(4) Ignore any narrow strip of habitat parallel to the road (for instance,
a line of trees or shrubs between the road and a field).

<p>

(5) Make a judgment about the predominant habitat within 50 meters
(yards) of the road (half the length of a football field).

<p>

(6) If more than one code applies to one place, <font color=#ff0000>list
the appropriate codes in order</font> from the most to the least
predominant (three codes maximum, please!).

<p>

(7) If there is a building (not permanently abandoned) within 50 meters
(yards), <font color=#ff0000>record code B first</font>, regardless of
what surrounds the building.

<p><p>

<center><h4>Codes for Seven Major Habitat Categories</h4></center>

<p>

<b>B</b> -- building(s) (except permanently abandoned ones) and areas
heavily used by humans (lawns, athletic fields, golf courses, barnyards)

<p>

<b>H</b> -- forest (treetops touching each other) with hardwoods composing
more than 90% of the canopy

<p>

<b>M</b> - forest with pines and hardwoods mixed in the canopy (hardwoods
50-90% of the canopy)

<p>

<b>P</b> -- forest with more than half the canopy pines (hardwoods less
than 50% of the canopy)

<p>

<b>S</b> -- second-growth (including areas with shrubs or scattered trees)

<p>

<b>0</b> -- open areas with low vegetation (recent clear-cuts,
agricultural fields including fallow and hay fields) -- but not lawns and
athletic fields (these are coded B as explained above)

<p>

<b>W</b> -- water (lake, pond, river, stream) -- often used as a secondary
code after one of the above codes

<p><p>

<center><font color=#ff0000><i>SPECIAL  NOTE!</i></font>

<p>

If you have time . . .

<p>

revisit your habitat codes from preceding
years and bring them into compliance with the new guidelines (especially
by adding asterisks for codes that have changed in the preceding
year) . . . 

<p>

we can then make any adjustments in our overall database.
