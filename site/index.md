title:  The Mini-Bird Breeding Survey
---

A *Mini Breeding Bird Survey* (MBBS) is a small-scale version of the full
[Breeding Bird Survey](https://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/bbs/)
organized each year by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
throughout North America.
An MBBS focuses on one county.
Volunteers count birds seen or heard
along randomly chosen routes on secondary roads.
The objective is to determine the distribution of breeding birds in the county
and to assess any year-to-year changes in their numbers.

## Importance

The importance of this survey is ... TODO.

The following visualizations shows trends
for 4 of the 100+ species observed in over twenty years of our survey.
As you can see,

* species such as Wood Thrush have declined;
* species such as Eastern Bluebird have no obvious trend;
* species such as Summer Tanager appearing to be increasing in abundance.
