<h4>Objective</h4>

to collect information about the distribution of breeding birds in Orange
County <br> and any changes in their abundance from year to year

<h4>Basic Method</h4>

record all birds seen or heard from points one half mile apart along
secondary roads; <br> one or two people can count (others can drive or
assist otherwise)

<h4>Procedures</h4>

Basic procedures

<ol>

<li>pick a day for your count between May 15 and June 30; a Sunday morning
is a good time because there is little traffic then

<li>arrive at the starting point in time to start your first count exactly
30 minutes before sunrise <font color=#ff0000>(about 5:30 EDT for our area
in early June)</font>

<li>drive exactly 0.5 miles between counts by the odometer in your car

<li>if it is unsafe to stop at the 0.5-mile mark (or the 0.5-mile mark
falls on a numbered highway) continue to the first place on your route
where it is safe to stop (for the next count, proceed 0.5 miles from this
adjusted position)

<li>continue until you have made 20 stops (9.5 miles if all intervals are
0.5 miles)

</ol>

Making each roadside count

<ol>

<li>get out of your car beside the road and get your data sheet ready

<li>record how many individuals of each species you see or hear within
exactly 3.0 minutes from the time you are ready to start

<li>if you are interrupted, or if traffic noise makes listening
impossible, add an equivalent amount of time to the 3.0 minutes

<li>do not count any birds heard or seen more than 0.25 miles away

<li>record the general kind of habitat on each side of the road

<li>use one of the sample data sheets (link at the top of this page).

</ol>

Hints

<ul>

<li>The first time you run a route, it will take some extra time to learn
the turns and stopping places.

<li>A good <b>county map with the names of secondary roads</b> is
essential.

<li><font color=#ff0000>Make a list of your stops </font> so you can
remember them next year! &nbsp; Describe each stop briefly (for instance,
"after the yellow house", or "just past the white fence").

<li>Your first few roadside counts will also need some getting used to.
But it shouldn't be long before you have established a routine.

<li>Like the national BBS, the results will be most useful when the
<b>same people do the same routes year after year</b>.

<li>The longer we can keep doing these MBBS routes the more interesting
they will become!

</ul>

Before you run your route . . .

<ul>

<li> Notify the county sheriff's office that you will be counting birds
early in the morning.

<li> Make a sign with big letters -- Bird Count -- to display on your
car.

<li> Enlist a friend to help out.

</ul>

<h4>Random Routes</h4>

MBBS routes are positioned without reference to known birding "hot spots".
&nbsp;  They are intended to provide an unbiased record of bird
populations.

<p>

<li>Routes for Orange County were selected randomly within some limits.
&nbsp; Technically, they are a stratified random sample. &nbsp;The County
was divided into sixths, and a random point was selected in each sixth.

<p>

Then, in each sixth of the county, a route was identified that fit these
criteria . . .

<ol>

<li>the route must stay on secondary roads (neither NC nor US routes) as
much as possible

<li>it must pass through the random point (or as close to it as
possible)

<li>it must maintain a NE-SW or NW-SE alignment (chosen randomly) as far
as possible

</ol>

<p>

Then a second random point was selected in each sixth of the county.
&nbsp; A second route was identified that fit the same criteria, except
that it included the second random point and it maintained a direction
perpendicular to the first route.

<p>

Each route was named after its starting point.

<p>

Some routes pass through suburban or urban areas -- it is important to
survey these habitats too!

<p>

<li>Routes for Chatham County were selected in the same way -- with one
modification. &nbsp;  Each route started at a random point (rather than
included a random point). &nbsp; If a route hit the county boundary, it
reflected (like a ray of light) back into the county.

<p>

Two routes were added (bringing the total to 14) in order to fill
conspicuous gaps in the random sampling (even stratifying the county into
sixths left some big holes in the sampling!).
