<h4>Objective</h4>

to collect information about the distribution of breeding birds in Orange County <br> and any changes in their abundance from year to year

<h4>Basic Method</h4>

record all birds seen or heard from points one half mile apart along secondary roads; <br> one or two people can count (others can drive or assist otherwise)

<h4>Procedures</h4>

Basic procedures

<ol>

<li>pick a day for your count between May 15 and June 30; a Sunday morning is a good time because there is little traffic then

<li>arrive at the starting point in time to start your first count exactly 30 minutes before sunrise <font color=#ff0000>(about 5:30 EDT for our area in early June)</font>

<li>drive exactly 0.5 miles between counts by the odometer in your car

<li>if it is unsafe to stop at the 0.5-mile mark (or the 0.5-mile mark falls on a numbered highway) continue to the first place on your route where it is safe to stop (for the next count, proceed 0.5 miles from this adjusted position)

<li>continue until you have made 20 stops (9.5 miles if all intervals are 0.5 miles)

</ol>

Making each roadside count

<ol>

<li>get out of your car beside the road and get your data sheet ready

<li>record how many individuals of each species you see or hear within exactly 3.0 minutes from the time you are ready to start

<li>do not count any birds heard or seen more than 0.25 miles away

<li>also record the general kind of habitat on each side of the road

<li>see the sample data sheets (see two links at the top of this page).

</ol>

Hints

<ul>

<li>The first time you run a route, it will take some extra time to learn the turns and stopping places. 

<li>A good <b>county map with the names of secondary roads</b> is essential. 

<li><font color=#ff0000>LAST MINUTE SUGGESTION:  make a list of your stops so you can remember them next year! </font> Describe each stop briefly (for instance, "after the yellow house", or "just past the white fence").

<li>Your first few roadside counts will also need some getting used to. But it shouldn't be long before you have established a routine. 

<li>Like the national BBS, the results will be most useful when the <b>same people do the same routes year after year</b>. 

<li>The longer we can keep doing these MBBS routes the more interesting they will become!

</ul>

<h4>Random Routes</h4>

To provide an unbiased record of bird populations, routes for MBBS are selected randomly within some limits. Technically, they are a stratified random sample. The County was divided into sixths, and a random point was selected in each sixth. 

<p>

A route was then identified that fit these criteria . . .

<ol>

<li>the route must stay on secondary roads (neither NC nor US routes) as much as possible

<li>it must pass through the random point (or as close to it as possible)

 <li>it must maintain a NE-SW or NW-SE alignment (chosen randomly) as far as possible

</ol>

Each route is named after its starting point.

<p>

Some routes pass through suburban or urban areas -- it is important to survey these habitats too!
