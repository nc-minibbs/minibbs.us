<h3>Balance of Reproduction and Survival
</h3>
</center>

<p><img src=blackpixel.gif height=1 width=100%><p>

Why don't lizards with high survival also have high fecundity?

<p>

<dd>Do lizards adjust reproduction in order to prevent over-population? 

<p>

Why does reproduction decrease as population size increases? 

<p>

<dd>Do Red Deer adjust reproduction in order to reduce over-population? 

<p>

<dd>for example . . . why don't female Red Deer always give birth
at age 3 -- or age 2 -- or age 1? 

<p><img src=blackpixel.gif height=1 width=100%><p>

There are two kinds of answers to these questions . . . 

<ul>

<li><b>proximate (physiological)</b> explanation -- females have not
reached full size and their ovaries do not mature before age 3, so they do
not ovulate or copulate before then

<p>

<li><b>ultimate (evolutionary)</b> explanation -- earlier reproduction
results in higher mortality of mothers or young, so alleles associated
with earlier reproduction do not spread under conditions that Red Deer
experience

</ul>

<b>individuals</b> can respond to increased chances of mortality with
compensating changes in behavior or physiology

<p>

<b>populations</b> can respond to increased chances of mortality
with changes in the frequencies of alleles

<p>

a full understanding of density-dependent changes in populations (or
anything else about animals and plants) requires <b>both</b> kinds of
explanation!

<p><img src=blackpixel.gif height=1 width=100%><p>

as populations of Red Deer increase, age of first reproduction increases,
fewer females have calves two years in succession, males have smaller
antlers . . . 

<p>

these changes are a result of physiological changes (a
<b>proximate explanation</b>) -- as populations increase there is less
food for each incdividual on average -- experiments with captive deer show
that reduced food intake results in postponed reproduction and lower
fecundity of females and smaller antlers of males 

<p>

are these changes also a result of natural selection (an <b>ultimate
explanation</b>)? -- how could we find out?

<p><img src=blackpixel.gif height=1 width=100%><p>

an evolutionary (ultimate) explanation focuses on changes in frequencies
of alleles in a population

<p>

two terms are important in discussing these genetic changes . . . 

<p>

<b>evolution</b> 

<dd>a change in the frequency of alleles in a population

<p>

<b>natural selection</b>

<dd>differences in the rate of spread of alleles in a population as a
result of differences in survival or reproduction of phenotypes associated
with those alleles

<p>

natural selection thus occurs when alleles are associated with phenotypes
that differ in age-specific fecundity or survival -- alleles spread faster
when associated with higher rates of increase of descendants

<p>

only rarely is it possible to do an experiment to show that a change in a
population's reproduction or survival has resulted from natural selection
. . . but there is one such experiment for vertebrates . . .

<p><img src=blackpixel.gif height=1 width=100%><p>

wild populations of Guppies <i>Poecilia reticulata</i> in Trinidad
(studied by David Resnick and John Endler) show that natural selection can
produce different balances of growth, reproduction, and survival

<p>

guppies inhabit shallow streams, females give birth to live young, males
develop bright colors and court larger females -- in lowland streams a
large predatory fish (<i>Crenicichla)</i>preys primarily on adult guppies
-- in mountain streams <i>Crenicichla</i> is absent but a small predator
(<i>Rivulus)</i>preys on juvenile guppies

<p>

we can compare populations of guppies in lowland and mountain streams
. . .

* Figures in the table are averages for each population.

<p><img src=blackpixel.gif height=1 width=100%><p>

in lowland populations both sexes mature earlier at a smaller size -- also
a female's first brood is larger -- although each baby is smaller, the
total mass of each brood is a larger proportion of the female's own mass
(see table below) -- guppies in lowland streams devote proportionately
more resources to reproduction than do those in mountain streams

<p>

note that, when predation decreases survival of adults, individuals
reproduce more at early ages -- when predation decreases survival of
juveniles, individuals do just the opposite (consequently they grow
faster, escape predation, and survive longer) 

<p>

are these differences genetic?

<p>

the clearest evidence for genetic influences on any trait (behavior,
physiology, or morphology) comes from breeding experiments in the
laboratory (cross-breeding individuals from within and between
populations) -- breeding experiments with guppies show that the
differences in growth and reproduction are genetic

<p>

how long does it take such genetic differences to evolve?  

<p>

Resnick and Endler transplanted guppies from a lowland stream to highland
streams that lacked guppies -- 11 years later (30-60 generations of
guppies) guppies there had changed genetically (as shown by more breeding
experiments) to resemble natural highland populations in most ways

<p>

. . . in other words, they had evolved

<p><img src=blackpixel.gif height=1 width=100%><p>

studies like these lead us to conclude . . . 

<p>

<b>life histories</b> (age-specific patterns of reproduction and survival)
are evolutionary adaptations -- they evolve in response to particular
environments just as morphology and physiology do

<p>

any environment (including other species) favors a particular <b>balance
of growth, reproduction, and survival</b> -- alleles spread if (and only
if) they are associated with phenotypes that have a favorable balance --
in other words, these alleles spread as a result of natural selection

<p>

an adaptive balance between growth, reproduction and survival is often
constrained by unavoidable <b>trade-offs</b> -- most organisms must make
trade-offs between survival, reproduction, and growth because . . . 

<ul> 

<li>individuals have a limited supply of resources (time, shelter,
energy from food)  

<li>reproduction, growth, and survival are not fully compatible (in other
words, resources used for reproduction often cannot also be used for
growth or survival -- and vice versa)

</ul>

. . .  so depending on the environment in which a population lives (risks
of mortality, opportunities for reproduction, sources of food, competition
with other species) different balances between growth, reproduction and
survival maximize the spread of alleles

<p>

. . . and if the environment is likely to vary in the lifetime of an
individual, then alleles spread fastest when they are associated with
phenotypes that can adjust the balance between growth, reproduction, and
survival to the current environment (as do red deer and great tits)

<p><img src=blackpixel.gif height=1 width=100%><p>

<b>life tables are the key to understanding natural selection</b> --
alleles spread in a population when they are associated with phenotypes
with life history strategies (as summarized in life tables) that result in
higher per capita rate of increase of descendants
