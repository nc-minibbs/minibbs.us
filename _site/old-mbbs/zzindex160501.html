A Mini Breeding Bird Survey (MBBS) is a small-scale version of the full
Breeding Bird Survey organized each year by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service throughout North America.

<p>

An MBBS focuses on one county.  &nbsp; Volunteers count birds seen or
heard along randomly chosen routes on secondary roads.  &nbsp;  The
objective is to determine the distribution of breeding birds in the county
and to assess any year-to-year changes in their numbers.

<p>

An annual MBBS began in Orange County (12 routes) in 1999, in Chatham 
County (14 routes) in 2000, and in Durham County (8 routes) in 2002. 
&nbsp; The number of routes in each county varies with the size of the 
county.

<h4>A new decade for MBBS (2010 ...)</h4>

</center>

<p>

In 2010 we began to use eBird.org to store the results of our surveys.  
&nbsp; Coordinated by the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology and the 
National Audubon Society, eBird.org is now a widely used database for 
observations of birds worldwide.

<p>

By 2012 we had worked out kinks in this process . . . 

<p><image src="tp.GIF" height=1 width=100>

and we covered all routes in Durham County . . .

<p><image src="tp.GIF" height=1 width=200>

and all but a few in Orange and Chatham Counties!

<p>

Last year we covered . . . all (of 8) routes in Durham . . . 11 (of 14) in 
Chatham . . .

<p><image src="tp.GIF" height=1 width=200>

and 9 (of 12) in Orange Counties.  &nbsp;  We can do better!

<p>

<font color=red>For 2014, our goal is . . .

<p><image src="tp.GIF" height=1 width=100>

complete coverage in Durham and Orange . . .

<p><image src="tp.GIF" height=1 width=200>

and at least holding our own in Chatham!</font>

<p>

An <i>option for counting night birds</i> (beginning in 2013) ... arrive 
at the starting point 15 minutes early (45 minutes before sunrise, 
approximately 5:15 at our time of year) and count all birds heard during 
those 15 minutes, and then start your first 3-minute count and continue 
the survey as usual. &nbsp;

<p>

<i>Enter the counts for the extra 15 minutes in the Comments box</i> (see 
below for an example).

<h4>Reporting results by using eBird</h4>

</center>

<p>

Once you have run your route (review 

<a href=#procedures> our procedures</a> below) ...


<li>add up the total number of each species for the entire 20 stops

<li>log into ebird.org

(<a href=loggingintoebird.html>how to log 
in</a>)

<li>after logging in, click the tab "Submit Observations" near the top

<p>

On the page that appears ...

<p><center><img src="jpgs/locs.jpg" width=80% border=2></center>

<ol>

<li>choose your route in the drop-down menu "Select from My Locations" ...

<li>... then click "Continue"

</ol>

On the next page ... 

<p><center><img src="jpgs/date.jpg" width=80% border=2></center>

<ol>

<li>enter the date you ran your route

<li>click the button for "Traveling"

</ol>

... which expands the page so you can enter ...

<p><center><img src="jpgs/comment.jpg" width=80% border=2></center>

<ol>

<li>the start time (usually 5:30 -- don't forget to add AM)
)
<li>the duration (within 10 minutes or so)

<li>the distance covered (always 10.0 miles)

<li>the number (of observers) in your party (normally 1 or 2)

<li>and "Comments" about your route

</ol>

Your comments should include ...

<ol>

<li>names of observers (for instance, "observers=Firstname Lastname, Firstname 
Lastname")

<li>names of other participants such as driver or recorder (for instance, 
"others=Firstname Lastname")

<li>weather such as temperature, cloud cover, and wind in general terms 
(for instance, "weather=75F, partly cloudy, light wind, patches of fog early")

<li>the total number of vehicles during the 20 three-minute obervations 
(for instance, "vehicles=23", with no spaces), and

<li>any change in the habitat at any stop (for instance, "habitat@16R=B", 
with no spaces, meaning the new habitat code on the righthand side of the 
route at stop 16 is now B)

<li>any other notes or observations (for instance, "notes=Cooper's Hawk flew 
past after the count at stop 4, 3 Eastern Screech-Owls, 2 Barred Owls, 1 
Great Horned Owl, 4 Whip-poor-wills, 2 Chuck-wills-widows during 15 minutes 
before the start")

<li>use <b>semicolons to separate</b> these types of information (also omit 
the quotes from the examples above)

<li><b>here's an example</b> of a complete entry in this box ...

<blockquote>

observers=Haven Wiley, John Doe; others=Minna Wiley; weather=75F, partly 
cloudy, light wind, patches of fog early; vehicles=23; habitat@4L=S; notes=1 
Barred Owl in 15 minutes before the start

</blockquote>

</ol>

After entering these "Comments", click "Continue" to reach the final page 
...

<p><center><img src="jpgs/what.jpg" width=80% border=2></center>

<p>

... where you can enter your totals in the appopriate boxes (scroll down 
as necessary).

<p>

Once your totals are entered and you reach the bottom of the page  ...

<ol>

<li>click the button "Yes" for submitting a complete checklist

<li>and then click the big green button "Submit"

</ol>


<center><img src="jpgs/submit.jpg" width=80% border=2></center>

<p>

On the next page, you are congratulated on a job well done ...

<p>

"Your checklist has been submitted! Please review it carefully and make 
any necessary changes."

<p>

Notice that you can change anything you have entered (if you made a 
mistake).

<p>

Also notice the button near the top right corner "All Checklists". &nbsp; 
Clicking this button takes you to a list of all checklists so far 
submitted!

<p>

This list of checklists, allows you to "Edit" or "Delete" any of them (in 
case you think of a mistake later ... but please do not delete anybody 
else's list!). &nbsp; You can also "Share" your checklist with another 
eBirder (or with your own eBird account).

<p>

Click the tab "My eBird" near the top to take you back to the MBBS home 
page ... and finally "Sign Out" (although this step is not necessary if 
you close your web browser or the current tab).

<h4>Why change the procedures for reporting data?</h4>

</center>

<p>

<li>By using eBird, our data become available to the whole world for 
scientific analysis!

<p>

<li>We no longer need someone to put our results on a website for us all 
to see -- somebody has a lot more time for birding (rather than web 
programming) as a result!

<p>

<li>Even better, it is easier to start an MBBS in other counties or in 
other states or wherever! &nbsp;  A new MBBS requires somebody to select 
suitable routes (see the guidelines in our procedures), and to use Google 
Earth (or a GPS device) to obtain the coordinates of each starting 
location, and to spend a few hours with eBird to set up an account with 
the locations for the routes -- not really too much to do!

<p>

<center>

<h4>What hasn't changed?</h4>

</center>

<p>

<li>A successful MBBS still needs a <b>county coordinator</b> to make sure 
that participants are identified and that the routes are run and that the 
counts are entered in eBird. &nbsp; However, that job has gotten easier -- 
because any one of us can use eBird to see a list of the routes for which 
results have been entered. &nbsp; The coordinator can then focus on the 
participants whose routes are not in the list!

<p>

<li>An overall coordinator is also necessary to check the data 
submitted. &nbsp; This person's email is associated with the eBird 
account, so eBird will contact that person if it spots something 
irregular. &nbsp; In addition, this person can check the "Notes" box for 
each count and edit for consistency and format.

<h4>Comments on the procedures for submitting reports</h4>

</center>

<p>

<li><i>Choosing locations from the drop-down menu</i> -- One reason for 
shifting to eBird is that our data become available to anybody who would 
like to analyze them. &nbsp; eBird follows the protocols for formatting 
data in the Avian Knowledge Network, so data can be downloaded for 
scientific study (it works although some programming is required!). &nbsp; 
To allow our MBBS data to be identified for downloading, it is crucial that 
<i>the names of the locations of our routes follow strict formats</i> 
including spaces, commas, and capitalization. &nbsp; Using the drop-down 
menu to select the location of an MBBS route solves this problem!

<p>

<li><i>Vehicles and habitat codes</i> -- A disadvantage of using eBird is 
that there is no easy way to enter the total number of vehicles on a route 
(those passing during the 20 three-minute observations) or any changes in 
habitat codes from year to year. &nbsp; By adding this information in the 
box for notes, it will be possible to retrieve it when data are downloaded 
from the Avian Knowledge Network, provided we use the format suggested 
above (for instance, "vehcles=17" and "habitat@7L=M").

<p>

<li><i>Sharing ebird counts</i> -- Another disadvantage of eBird arises 
for birders who use eBird to manage their year, state, county, and life 
lists!  &nbsp; If you enter an MBBS route after logging into your own 
eBird account, the data will not appear in the appropriate MBBS account 
for us all to see easily (and there is the risk that the name of the 
location will not have the requisite format!). &nbsp; If you then share 
this count with the appropriate ebird account, we can see it (and the name 
of the location can be corrected if necessary). &nbsp; But ...

<p>

<li><i>Sharing eBird counts (the bottom line)</i> -- It is much better to 
enter the data in the appropriate MBBS account and then share it with your 
own account ... that way you can use the drop-down menu in the MBBS 
account to select the location with the correct format ... all of the 
species and numbers will also be tallied in your own account!

<p>

<li><i>Locations and distances</i> -- The locations of the routes are the 
<i>starting places</i> (please let me know if you spot a significant 
error!). &nbsp; eBird suggests using the coordinates for the aproximate 
center of a traveling count, but for us the starting position is much more 
critical. &nbsp; Although our routes only involve driving 9.5 miles from 
stop 1 to stop 20, we include all birds recorded within 0.25 miles of the 
first and last stops, so the total distance for an MBBS route is 10.0 
miles.
