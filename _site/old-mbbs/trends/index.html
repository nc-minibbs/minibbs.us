These graphs show the total number of individuals of

each species recorded on <i>all routes in one county</i>

in each year.

<p>

Each species has a

<a target="_blank"

<font color=red><i>four-letter code</i></font></a> 

(usually the

first two letters of its first name and the first

two letters of the its second name (for instance,

EABL for Eastern Bluebird).

<p>

Some species show <i>trends</i> (either upward or

downward) in their numbers over the period of the

surveys. &nbsp; A <i>straight line</i> on a graph

indicates a trend that is <i>statistically significant</i>

(not likely to be an erroneous conclusion) <i>or

almost</i> statistically significant.

<p>

<b>**</b>

A <font color=red><i>double asterisk</i></font> in the upper right corner

of a graph indicates a <i>highly significant trend</i> (with a

probability of error less than 1%).

<p>

<b>*</b>
   
A <font color=red><i>single asterisk</i></font> in the upper right corner

indicates a significant trend (with a probability

of error less than 5% but greater than 1%).

<p>

A <font color=red>line but <i>no asterisk</i></font> indicates a

possible trend (with a probability of error less

than 10% but greater than 5%).

Some details . . .

<p>

The lines for trends were calculated with procedure lm{stats}

and the graphs were prepared with plot{graphics} in R 2.9.2

for Mac (GUI 1.29) (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing 2009).

<p>

The data are available in a text (ASCII) file as a tab-delimited table which
can be read into a data frame in R at

analysis</a>

<p>

Although the volunteers who conducted these surveys did a great job of 
covering nearly each route every year, there were a few gaps, when a route 
was not surveyed one year. &nbsp; Because the numbers of routes in each 
county were not high (8-14 routes per county), these missed routes could 
have a noticeable effect on the numbers of each species recorded that year. 
&nbsp; To reduce this effect, the missing values were filled with the 
average number of each species recorded on that route during years when it 
was not missed. &nbsp; This procedure would slightly reduce any trend in the 
numbers of each species. &nbsp; The numbers of routes missed during the 
survey were small (1 in Orange County, 2 in Chatham County, and 1 in Durham 
County, each in one year only).

There is a graph for every species except the rare ones (those species 
encountered on the surveys fewer than 5 times on average each year in each 
county). &nbsp; These birds were too scarce to analyze.

<p>

For information about reading these graphs, see the sidebar to the left.

<p>

Notice the <font style="color:red; font-size:14px"><i>downward 
trends</i></font> in Chimney Swifts, 
Red-eyed Vireos, Barn Swallows, and Wood Thrushes.

<p>

There are <i>upward trends</i> in Fish Crows in Chatham and Durham Counties.

<p>

Among the species <i>holding their own</i>, despite nationwide concerns 
about their populations, are Eastern Meadowlark and many (but not all) 
warblers and tanagers.

<p>

Check the graphs for some surprises!

<blockquote>

<font style="font-size:10px">

In summary, the surveys consist of randomly located routes in each county 
(12 in Orange, 14 in Chatham, 8 in Durham, the smallest of the three 
counties). &nbsp; Observers stop to count birds every half mile along 
randomly located 10-mile routes on secondary roads. &nbsp; Although these 
surveys do not detect <i>all</i> the birds in a county, they do provide a 
reasonaby dense random sampling of the birds.  &nbsp; They thus are a basis 
for evaluating trends in numbers of birds. &nbsp; Because the surveys take 
place on mornings in May and June, they focus on breeding birds. &nbsp; 
Because they are made from roads in the first couple of hours after sunrise, 
they detect some species more reliably than others. &nbsp; For instance, 
nocturnal birds (owls and whip-poor-wills), soaring birds (most hawks and 
vultures), and birds of deep forest are no doubt underestimated. &nbsp; 
Nevertheless, even these birds are sampled consistently from year to year.
