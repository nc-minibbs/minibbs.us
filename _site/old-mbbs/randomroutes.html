<center><h4>Random Routes for MBBS</h4></center>

MBBS routes are positioned without reference to known birding "hot spots"!
&nbsp;  They are intended to provide an unbiased record of bird
populations.  &nbsp; And they can lead to unexpected discoveries!

<p>

<li>Routes for <b>Orange County</b> were selected randomly within some
limits. &nbsp; Technically, they are a stratified random sample. &nbsp;The
County was divided into sixths, and a random point was selected in each
sixth.

<p>

Then, in each sixth of the county, a route was identified that fit these
criteria . . .

<ol>

<li>the route must stay on secondary roads (neither NC nor US routes) as
much as possible

<li>it must pass through the random point (or as close to it as
possible)

<li>it must maintain a NE-SW or NW-SE alignment (chosen randomly) as far
as possible

</ol>

<p>

Then a second random point was selected in each sixth of the county.
&nbsp; A second route was identified that fit the same criteria, except
that it included the second random point and it maintained a direction
perpendicular to the first route.

<p>

Each route was named after its starting point.

<p>

Some routes pass through suburban or urban areas -- it is important to
survey these habitats too!

<p>

<li>Routes for <b>Chatham County</b> were selected in the same way -- with
one modification. &nbsp;  Each route started at a random point (rather
than included a random point). &nbsp; If a route hit the county boundary,
it reflected (like a ray of light) back into the county.

<p>

Two routes were added (bringing the total to 14) in order to fill
conspicuous gaps in the random sampling (even stratifying the county into
sixths left some big holes in the sampling!).

<p>

<li>Routes for <b>Durham County</b> were selected in the same way that
Chatham County routes were selected -- except that there was no need for
more than eight routes.
