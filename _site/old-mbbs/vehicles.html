<center><h4>Counting Vehicles on MBBS Routes</h4></center>

The objective in counting vehicles at each stop is to produce information
about

<p>

<ul>

<li>the overall level of human activity along a route


<p>

<li>any changes in this level from year to year

</ul>

<p>

<center><h4>Procedure</h4></center>

<p>

A simple way to estimate human activity is to <font color=#ff0000><b>count 
the number of vehicles</b></font> during a <font 
color=#ff0000><b>three-minute period</b></font> at each stop.  &nbsp;  
Usually you can count vehicles during the same three minutes you count 
birds. &nbsp; Any contraption moving on the ground with a motor counts as a 
vehicle!

<p>

If you extend the three minutes for counting birds to compensate for heavy 
traffic, <b>do not make an extension for the traffic</b>.  &nbsp;  Instead 
just count vehicles during the first three minutes -- whether or not the 
traffic is heavy!

<p>

If things are happening fast (lots of birds, lots of traffic), then the 
birds come first! &nbsp; <b>Count</b> the birds the best you can -- and 
<b>estimate</b> (guess) the number of vehicles the best you can.
