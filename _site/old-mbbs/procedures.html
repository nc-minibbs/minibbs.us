Basic procedures

<ol>

<li>pick a day for your count between May 15 and June 30; a Sunday morning
is a good time because there is little traffic then

<li>arrive at the starting point in time to start your first count exactly
30 minutes before sunrise <font color=#ff0000>(about 5:30 EDT for our area
in early June)</font>

<li>drive exactly 0.5 miles between counts by the odometer in your car

<li>if it is unsafe to stop at the 0.5-mile mark (or the 0.5-mile mark
falls on a numbered highway) continue to the first place on your route
where it is safe to stop (for the next count, proceed 0.5 miles from this
adjusted position)

<li>continue until you have made 20 stops (9.5 miles if all intervals are
0.5 miles)

</ol>

Making each roadside count

<ol>

<li>get out of your car beside the road and get your data sheet ready

<li>record how many individuals of each species you see or hear within
exactly 3.0 minutes from the time you are ready to start

<li>if you are interrupted, or if traffic noise makes listening
impossible, add an equivalent amount of time to the 3.0 minutes

<li>do not count any birds heard or seen more than 0.25 miles away

<li>record the habitat on each side of the road (see

<a href="habitatcodes.html">habitat codes</a>)

<li>use one of the sample data sheets (see 

<a href="dataforms/index.html">dataforms</a>)

</ol>

Hints

<ul>

<li>The first time you run a route, it will take some extra time to learn
the turns and stopping places.


<li>A good <b>county map with the names of secondary roads</b> is
essential.

<li><font color=#ff0000>Make a list of your stops </font> so you can
remember them next year! &nbsp; Describe each stop briefly (for instance,
"after the yellow house", or "just past the white fence").

<li>Your first few roadside counts will also need some getting used to.
But it shouldn't be long before you have established a routine.

<li>Like the national BBS, the results will be most useful when the
<b>same people do the same routes year after year</b>.

<li>The longer we can keep doing these MBBS routes the more interesting
they will become!

</ul>

Before you run your route . . .

<ul>

<li> Notify the county sheriff's office that you will be counting birds
early in the morning.

<li> Make a sign with big letters -- Bird Count -- to display on your
car.

<li> Enlist a friend to help out.

</ul>
