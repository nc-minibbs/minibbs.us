title: History of the Mini Bird Breeding Survey
---

An annual MBBS began in Orange County (12 routes) in 1999,
in Chatham County (14 routes) in 2000,
and in Durham County (8 routes) in 2002.
The number of routes in each county varies with the size of the county.

In 2010 we began to use eBird.org to store the results of our surveys.
Coordinated by the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology and the National Audubon Society,
eBird.org is now a widely used database for observations of birds worldwide.

By 2012 we had worked out kinks in this process,
and we covered all routes in Durham County
and all but a few in Orange and Chatham Counties.
In 2019, Professor Emeritus at UNC and local legend
[Haven Wiley](http://rhwiley.bio.unc.edu/) retired as organizer of the survey.
[Allen Hurlbert](http://labs.bio.unc.edu/hurlbert/index.html)
and
[Bradley Saul](https://functionalstatistics.com/)
took the reins.
