This form includes all species so far recorded on Orange, Chatham, or
Durham MBBS routes (plus a couple of extra spaces at the bottom). &nbsp;  
It also has spaces for the numbers of vehicles at each stop.

<p>

You must have Microsoft Excel on your computer (Mac or Windows) or some
other spreadsheet program to use these forms.  &nbsp;  One of these forms
should work with any version of Excel or any other spreadsheet or database
program.  &nbsp;  Let

The forms below can be viewed with your web browser and printed for use in
the field.

<!--
These forms use the standardized <b>four-letter abbreviations for species
names</b>.  &nbsp;  These abbreviations follow simple rules.  &nbsp; For
species with two names (like Eastern Bluebird), the abbreviation is the
first two letters of each name (EABL).  &nbsp;  For species with three
names (like Yellow-throated Warbler), the abbreviation includes the first
letter of each of the first two words and the first two letters of the
last word (YTWA).  &nbsp; The few species with four names are
straight-forward (Northern Rough-winged Swallow becomes NRWS).

<p>

There are a <b>few exceptions</b> to avoid duplicate abbreviations for
North American birds.  &nbsp;  Notice especially Prothonotary Warbler
(PROW) and Prairie Warbler (PRAW).  &nbsp;  Not so critical for our area
are Barn Swallow (BARS), Carolina Wren (CARW), and Cedar Waxwing (CEDW).  
&nbsp; Even these exceptions follow the general rule for exceptions (first
three letters of the first name and first letter of the second name).

<p>

The first two forms list species in <b>taxonomic order</b> like the order
in recent field guides. &nbsp; The first one lists the 45 most frequently
observed species on Orange-Chatham-Durham MBBS routes (plus lines for 
habitat codes and numbers of vehicles that pass you).  &nbsp; The second
lists other species recorded on at least two routes -- plus a few blank
lines.

<p>

The next two forms list species in <b>alphabetic order</b>.  &nbsp;  The
first again lists the most frequent species (with lines for habitats and
vehicles), and the second lists less frequent species.
