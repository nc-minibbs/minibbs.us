A Mini Breeding Bird Survey (MBBS) is a small-scale version of the full
Breeding Bird Survey organized each year by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service throughout North America.

<p>

An MBBS focuses on one county.  &nbsp; Volunteers count birds seen or
heard along randomly chosen routes on secondary roads.  &nbsp;  The
objective is to determine the distribution of breeding birds in the county
and to assess any year-to-year changes in their numbers.

<p>

An annual MBBS began in Orange County (12 routes) in 1999, in Chatham 
County (14 routes) in 2000, and in Durham County (8 routes) in 2002. 
&nbsp; The number of routes in each county varies with the size of the 
county.

<h4>A new decade for MBBS (2010 ...)</h4>

</center>

<p>

In 2010 we began to use eBird.org to store the results of our surveys.  
&nbsp; Coordinated by the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology and the 
National Audubon Society, eBird.org is now a widely used database for 
observations of birds worldwide.

<p>

By 2012 we had worked out kinks in this process . . . 

<p><image src="tp.GIF" height=1 width=100>

and we covered all routes in Durham County . . .

<p><image src="tp.GIF" height=1 width=200>

and all but a few in Orange and Chatham Counties!

<p>

Last year we covered 26 of our 34 routes overall . . . 

<p><image src="tp.GIF" height=1 width=50>

6 (of 8) routes in Durham . . . 
10 (of 12) in Orange . . .
and 10 (of 14) in Chatham Counties.

<p><image src="tp.GIF" height=1 width=200>

<font color=red>We can do better!</font>

<p>

Our goal is . . .

<p><image src="tp.GIF" height=1 width=50>

<font color=red> complete coverage in Durham and Orange . . .

<p><image src="tp.GIF" height=1 width=200>

and at least holding our own in Chatham!</font>

<h4>Why eBird for reporting data?</h4>

</center>

<p>

<li>By using eBird, our numbers become available fo anyone to use for 
scientific analysis!

<p>

<li>It is easier to start an MBBS in other counties or in 
other states or wherever (see needs below)! 

<p>

<center>

<h4>Reporting results by using eBird</h4>

</center>

<p>

<blockquote>

<i>Option for counting night birds</i> (beginning in 2013) ... arrive at 
the starting point 15 minutes early (45 minutes before sunrise, 
approximately 5:15 at our time of year) and count all birds heard during 
those 15 minutes, and then start your first 3-minute count and continue 
the survey as usual. &nbsp; <i>Enter counts for the extra 15 minutes in 
the Comments box</i> (see below for an example).

</blockquote>

<p>

Once you have run your route (review 

<a href=#procedures> our procedures</a> below) ...


<li>add up the total number of each species for the entire 20 stops

<li>log into ebird.org

(<a href=http://www.unc.edu/~rhwiley/mbbs/loggingintoebird.html>how to log 
in</a>)

<li>after logging in, click the tab "Submit Observations" near the top

<p>

On the page that appears ...

<p><center><img src="jpgs/locs.jpg" width=80% border=2></center>

<ol>

<li>choose your route in the drop-down menu "Select from My Locations" ...

<li>... then click "Continue"

</ol>

On the next page ... 

<p><center><img src="jpgs/date.jpg" width=80% border=2></center>

<ol>

<li>enter the date you ran your route

<li>click the button for "Traveling"

</ol>

... which expands the page so you can enter ...

<p><center><img src="jpgs/comment.jpg" width=80% border=2></center>

<ol>

<li>the start time (usually 5:30 -- don't forget to add AM)
)
<li>the duration (within 10 minutes or so)

<li>the distance covered (always 10.0 miles)

<li>the number (of observers) in your party (normally 1 or 2)

<li>and "Comments" about your route

</ol>

Your comments should include ...

<ol>

<li>names of observers (for instance, "observers=Firstname Lastname, Firstname 
Lastname")

<li>names of other participants such as driver or recorder (for instance, 
"others=Firstname Lastname")

<li>weather such as temperature, cloud cover, and wind in general terms 
(for instance, "weather=75F, partly cloudy, light wind, patches of fog early")

<li>the total number of vehicles during the 20 three-minute obervations 
(for instance, "vehicles=23", with no spaces), and

<li>any change in the habitat at any stop (for instance, "habitat@16R=B", 
with no spaces, meaning the new habitat code on the righthand side of the 
route at stop 16 is now B)

<li>any other notes or observations (for instance, "notes=Cooper's Hawk flew 
past after the count at stop 4, 3 Eastern Screech-Owls, 2 Barred Owls, 1 
Great Horned Owl, 4 Whip-poor-wills, 2 Chuck-wills-widows during 15 minutes 
before the start")

<li>use <b>semicolons to separate</b> these types of information (also omit 
the quotes from the examples above)

<li><b>here's an example</b> of a complete entry in this box ...

<blockquote>

observers=Haven Wiley, John Doe; others=Minna Wiley; weather=75F, partly 
cloudy, light wind, patches of fog early; vehicles=23; habitat@4L=S; notes=1 
Barred Owl in 15 minutes before the start

</blockquote>

</ol>

After entering these "Comments", click "Continue" to reach the final page 
...

<p><center><img src="jpgs/what.jpg" width=80% border=2></center>

<p>

... where you can enter your totals in the appopriate boxes (scroll down 
as necessary).

<p>

Once your totals are entered and you reach the bottom of the page  ...

<ol>

<li>click the button "Yes" for submitting a complete checklist

<li>and then click the big green button "Submit"

</ol>


<center><img src="jpgs/submit.jpg" width=80% border=2></center>

<p>

On the next page, you are congratulated on a job well done ...

<p>

"Your checklist has been submitted! Please review it carefully and make 
any necessary changes."

<p>

Notice that you can change anything you have entered (if you made a 
mistake).

<p>

Also notice the button near the top right corner "All Checklists". &nbsp; 
Clicking this button takes you to a list of all checklists so far 
submitted!

<p>

This list of checklists, allows you to "Edit" or "Delete" any of them (in 
case you think of a mistake later ... but please do not delete anybody 
else's list!). &nbsp; You can also "Share" your checklist with another 
eBirder (or with your own eBird account).

<p>

Click the tab "My eBird" near the top to take you back to the MBBS home 
page ... and finally "Sign Out" (although this step is not necessary if 
you close your web browser or the current tab).

<h4>More comments on submitting reports</h4>

</center>

<p>

<li><i>Choosing locations from the drop-down menu</i> -- One reason for 
shifting to eBird is that our data become available to anybody who would 
like to analyze them. &nbsp; eBird follows the protocols for formatting 
data in the Avian Knowledge Network, so data can be downloaded for 
scientific study (it works although some programming is required!). &nbsp; 
To allow our MBBS data to be identified for downloading, it is crucial that 
<i>the names of the locations of our routes follow strict formats</i> 
including spaces, commas, and capitalization. &nbsp; Using the drop-down 
menu to select the location of an MBBS route solves this problem!

<p>

<li><i>Vehicles and habitat codes</i> -- A disadvantage of using eBird is 
that there is no easy way to enter the total number of vehicles on a route 
(those passing during the 20 three-minute observations) or any changes in 
habitat codes from year to year. &nbsp; By adding this information in the 
box for notes, it will be possible to retrieve it when data are downloaded 
from the Avian Knowledge Network, provided we use the format suggested 
above (for instance, "vehcles=17" and "habitat@7L=M").

<p>

<li><i>Sharing MBBS checklists with your own eBird account</i> -- It is 
best to enter the data in the appropriate MBBS account and then share it 
with your own account ... that way you can use the drop-down menu in the 
MBBS account to select the location with the correct format ... all of the 
species and numbers will also be tallied in your own account!

<p>

<li><i>Locations and distances</i> -- The locations of the routes are the 
<i>starting places</i> (please let me know if you spot a significant 
error!). &nbsp; eBird suggests using the coordinates for the aproximate 
center of a traveling count, but for us the starting position is much more 
critical. &nbsp; Although our routes only involve driving 9.5 miles from 
stop 1 to stop 20, we include all birds recorded within 0.25 miles of the 
first and last stops, so the total distance for an MBBS route is 10.0 
miles.

<b>What we need now</b>

</center>

<p>

<li><b>Participants</b> to pick up vacant routes
 
<blockquote>

Qualifications -- ability to identify our breeding birds (especially the 
regular ones) by song or calls as well as by sight -- interest in 
out-of-the-way parts of the area where we live -- participation in 
successive years (when possible) -- and, last but not least, willingness 
to submit standard reports that can be used to evaluate trends in the 
numbers of our breeding birds

</blockquote>

<li><b>County coordinators</b> for Orange and Chatham Counties

<blockquote>

Qualifications -- willingness to help in recruiting a few regular 
participants when needed (see above) -- a few minutes each week (for 
several weeks in the summer) to encourage participants to run their routes 
and to enter their results in eBird in a timely way.

</blockquote>

<li><b>Coordinators for additional Mini Breeding Birds Surveys</b> in 
other counties, states, or elsewhere

<blockquote>

To start a new MBBS, someone must select suitable routes (see the 
guidelines in our procedures), use Google Earth (or a GPS device) to 
obtain the coordinates of each starting location, spend a few hours with 
eBird to set up an account with the locations for the routes -- and, most 
important, recruit some partcipants!

<p>

It is also important to download and save the eBird checklists with each 
year's results.
