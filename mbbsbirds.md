title: "Breeding birds of Orange, Durham, and Chatham counties"
---

This list includes all species observed at least once on MBBS routes in Orange, Chatham, and Durham Counties, North Carolina (as of 2017-06-17) -- a total of 106 species!

Some of these species occur only in a few localities in these counties, and some have been found during the breeding season on only one or a few occasions. A few no doubt were just visiting.

The official English name for each species (approved by the American Ornithologists' Union) is followed by a four-letter code for the species (adopted by the USGS Bird-Banding Office).

**Note exceptional codes for a few species -- especially Prairie and Prothonotary Warblers!**
